# Hey 👋, I'm Si Moon

I'm a CS + Stats @ UBC passionate about building AI agents and full-stack systems that actually do something. Lately, I've been deeply invested in the intersection of agents, backend systems, and machine learning. That's led me to explore multi-agent orchestration and self-hosting infrastructure on my Raspberry Pi. One of my goals for 2026 is to code everyday so be sure to check out my GitHub! :D
